You gotta fly with the eagles into a whole other world into a whole other video game domain.
You gotta have the rhythm of a sleazy 70s muscle man combined with the ruthlessness of a 1990s video game killer in the online gaming community.
I'm a 6 foot 8 gaming powerhouse like I've said many many many times. I'm the 1993 1994 two time back to back, yea, multiple years back to back consecutive years, the two time blockbuster video game champion in the online gaming community.
I'm an international video game superstar. Trust me when I say this, when I hop out of the 1990 Lamborghini Diablo VT...everyone's wants a picture.
